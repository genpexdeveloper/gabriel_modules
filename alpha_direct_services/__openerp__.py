Connect OpenERP with Alpha Direct Services
==========================================

Introduction
------------

This module synchronises OpenERP records with Alpha Direct Services (ADS), the logistics company, by modifying workflows to upload data to ADS, and periodically polling ADS to download updates to uploaded records. 

Key Features
------------
* Incoming Shipments are uploaded when in "Ready To Receive" state. They will then be "Received" when the polling service receives the data from ADS 
* Delivery Orders are uploaded when in "Ready to Deliver" state. They will then be "Delivered" when the polling service receives the data from ADS
* Returns are created when the polling service receives the data from ADS
* Physical Inventories are created when the polling service receives the data from ADS. Note that they are confirmed but not validated automatically.
* Full partial delivery / reception support

Configuration
-------------
Please enter your ADS FTP server credentials in Settings > Parameters > System Parameters > ads\_*. If "mode" is set to "test" any data will not be automatically imported by ADS. Set it to "prod" to have your data automatically imported.

By default this module poles the ADS API every 5 minutes. This interval can be changed by going to Settings > Scheduler > Scheduled Actions > Poll Alpha Direct Service Server

Technical Information
---------------------

#### Uploading

All hooks into OpenERP are kept in python files with names that match the \_name of the top most object in the workflow. For example in the Sales Order workflow, we upload the picking, but the sales\_order object is the top level object so the python file is called sales\_order.py.

All python files whose names are prefixed by "ads" and contain the name of an OE object (i.e. ads\_sales\_order.py) define how the OE object data should be extracted and uploaded to ADS. They inherit from the class ads\_data which defines certain entry points into the ADS interaction process. 

sale\_order.py hooks into the action\_assign\_wkf method and, after various checks, instantiates an object of type ads\_sales\_order with a browse\_record to the SO's picking. The \_\_init\_\_ method of ads\_data then calls extract on itself with the browse\_record as a parameter. Extract is overridden in the ads\_sales\_order class and extracts data from the browse record, inserting it into self.data which is a dictionary based struct. sales\_order then calls "upload" on the ads\_sale\_order object.

Upload is defined by ads\_data. It gets a connection to the ADS FTP server, then calls upload\_data on the ftp server, passing in the ads\_data child class. The ads\_connection object then calls generate\_xml on the ads\_data class which uses the pickling tools library to output XML generated from the self.data struct. This is then written to a file on the FTP server.

#### Downloading

ads\_manager.py provides a poll function that is periodically called by OE. This function gets a connection to the FTP server and gets a list of files that exist to be imported into OE.

It sorts the files based on the creation date, then by its data type (defined by the file name prefix). Next, it searches for a child class of ads\_data whose file\_name\_prefix property contains the datatype prefix of the file to process. Then, it downloads the contents of the file and instantiates an instance of the ads\_data child class with the file contents as a parameter. The \_\_init\_\_ of ads\_data converts the XML into a python dict struct with the help of the pickling tools library. 

Then it calls process\_all on the class. This is defined in ads\_data. It then loops through all root node elements passing the element to self.process which is overridden in the child class to do something with the data, for example closing a picking etc.

Finally it deletes the processed element from self.data. If any errors occur during the processing, they are stored, and the element is not deleted from self.data. At the end of the processing, if any errors have occured, a text file containing them and an XML file containing the leftover data is uploaded to the errors directory on the FTP server.

#### Summary
* ads\_connection class is a wrapper around the ftplib python class to connect to ADS with the configuration settings in OE. It also provides some helper methods.
* ads\_manager provides a poll function that periodically connects to ADS and downloads and processes XML files
* ads\_data is a parent class for ads\_*object\_name* classes and defines methods like upload, extract and process\_all
* ads\_*object\_name* classes extend ads\_data and override process and extract (sometimes more) methods to determine how OE should import the data from ADS
